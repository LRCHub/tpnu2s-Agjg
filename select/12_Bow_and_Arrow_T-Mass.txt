You're a bow and arrow
A broken guitar
While the rain, water washes away who you are
We go over the mountains and under the stars
We go over the mountains and under the stars

You're a bow and arrow
A broken guitar
While the rain, water washes away who you are
We go over the mountains and under the stars
We go over the mountains and under the stars

Won't you fold my hands over my heart?
I want you to close my eyes when it grows dark
Oh, we go over the mountains and under the stars
We go over the mountains and under the stars
We go over the mountains and under the stars
We go over the mountains and under the stars

Won't you fold my hands over my heart?
I want you to close my eyes when it grows dark

You're a bow and arrow
A broken guitar
While the rain, water washes away who you are
We go over the mountains and under the stars
We go over the mountains and under the stars
