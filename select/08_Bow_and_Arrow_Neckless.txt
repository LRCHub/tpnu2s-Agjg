I kinda always guessed they loved to brawl
I kinda always guessed it's all about
Destruction and combat
I never strived to see nor tried to get
The bottom of their plans
I never considered them to be right
They keep losing bow and arrow
They've no clue to find the cause
But they go on, on and on
Now that I pay attention to what they say
Now that I start to question I judge
My preconceptions as damn wrong
I'm not the kind of person to raise the flag
And take into the streets
What is my part to make them win
They keep losing bow and arrow
They defy and fight the laws
They keep losing bow and arrow
They defy and fight the laws
To go on, on and on, on and on
To go on and on, on and on
On and on and on
